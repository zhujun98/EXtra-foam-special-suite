**foamlight** is an evolution of [EXtra-foam special suite](https://extra-foam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/special_suite.html#introduction).
It aims at providing a powerful interface for real-time data analysis and visualization
as well as an open development interface for end users to design their own apps.

**foamlight** will continue to support receiving data from both the 
[EXtra-foam](https://github.com/European-XFEL/EXtra-foam) core
and the Karabo bridge. In addition, it also enables receiving data from 
[DOOCS](https://doocs-web.desy.de/index.html).
